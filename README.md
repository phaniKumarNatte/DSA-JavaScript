# DSA-JavaScript

This repository contains my solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems, all implemented in **JavaScript**.  

I have 4 years of experience as a Backend Developer (Node.js,CakePHP, MongoDB, MySQL, AWS).  
To strengthen my problem-solving and algorithms knowledge, I have been consistently practicing DSA in JavaScript.  
So far, I have solved 60+ problems and my goal is to reach 200+ problems by the end of 2025.
