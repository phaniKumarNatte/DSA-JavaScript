# Arrays Notes

## Math Functions
- Math.max: Find the largest number.
- Math.floor: Round down.
- Math.ceil: Round up.
- Math.round: Round to nearest integer.
- Math.abs: Absolute value.

## Relative Order
Relative order means the original order of elements is preserved after moving or filtering.

## Distinct Numbers
Distinct numbers are uniqueâ€”no duplicates.

## Subset
A set is a subset if all its elements exist in another set.

## Ascending vs Non-Decreasing Order
- Ascending: strictly increasing, no duplicates.
- Non-decreasing: allows duplicates.

## Two-pointer Technique
Only works on sorted arrays.


## Quick Interview Tips
- Know how to use prefix sums, sliding window, and two-pointer techniques for array problems.
- Practice problems on removing duplicates, moving zeroes, and merging sorted arrays.
- Understand time and space complexity for common array operations.

## Conceptual Insights
- Arrays are contiguous memory blocks; random access is O(1).
- Sorting is often a prerequisite for binary search and two-pointer approaches.
- Hashing (using objects or sets) is powerful for frequency and uniqueness checks.
