What is linear search?
//  linear search is an algorithm which searches for a specific value in a list by checking each element one by one until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the list.

Time complexity of linear search: 
                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Best Case    | O(1)    → Found at beginning        |
| Average Case | O(n)                                |
| Worst Case   | O(n)    → Found at end or not found |
