# Binary Search Notes

- Binary Search is only applicable for sorted arrays.

## Quick Interview Tips
- Always check for off-by-one errors in low/high/mid calculations.
- Practice finding first/last occurrence, peak element, and search in rotated arrays.
- Know how to adapt binary search for answer range (lower/upper bound problems).

## Conceptual Insights
- Binary search reduces search space by half each iteration (O(log n)).
- Can be applied to monotonic functions, not just arrays.
- Useful for optimization and decision problems (searching for minimum/maximum feasible value).
