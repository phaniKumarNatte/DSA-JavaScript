/**
 * Problem: Container With Most Water (LeetCode #11)
 * 
 * You are given an integer array `height` where each element represents
 * the height of a vertical line drawn on the x-axis.
 * 
 * The task is to find two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container 
 * that can hold the maximum amount of water.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
 * Output: 49
 * Explanation: The lines at index 1 (height=8) and index 8 (height=7) form the container
 *              with max area = min(8,7) * (8-1) = 7 * 7 = 49
 * 
 * Approach: Two Pointer Technique
 * - Start with two pointers: one at the beginning (left) and one at the end (right).
 * - Calculate the area between them.
 * - Move the pointer that points to the shorter line, because thatâ€™s the limiting factor
 *   in the area calculation.
 * - Keep track of the maximum area found.
 * - Continue until the two pointers meet.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
